      <description>In Camel 3.2.0 we&amp;rsquo;ll release the complete set of Camel AWS2 components. In Camel 3.1.0 we already have a bunch of AWS2 components living together with the original AWS components. The aim of this post is giving a full perspective of what will change for the end users and the roadmap for new features.
New components Except camel-aws-xray, which is a particular component needing much more work to be migrated, all the original AWS components have been migrated to AWS SDK v2.</description>
